Ubuntu does not provide the latest PHP version in its default software repositories.
We'll need to add a community-mainteined Personal Package Archive (PPA) instead.

Ondrej Sury maintains an excellent PPA that provides nightly builds for the latest stable PHP release.


1. Add software dependencies:
    We must make sure the add-apt-repository binary is available on our operating system.
This binary is included in the python-software-properties Ubuntu package.

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties


2. Add ppa:ondrej/
    This PPA expands Ubuntu's available software selection beyound the default Ubuntu software repositories.

    ppa:ondrej/php (For PHP 5.5/PHP 5.6/PHP 7.0)
    ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6 (For PHP 5.6)
    ppa:ondrej/apache2 (For Apache 2.4)

To add the PPA to Ubuntu's list of software sources:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

It downloads the PPA's GPG public key and appends it to our local GPG keyring.
The GPG public key enables Ubuntu to verify thah the packages in the PPA have not been tampered with since they were built and signed by their original author.


When we add new software sources, we need to refresh Ubuntu's cache.

    sudo apt-get update



3. Install PHP
    Before installing PHP, it is important to know which PHP packages are available and what they do.
PHP is distributed in two forms.
One form is a CLI package that enables you to use PHP on the command line.
The other form integrate PHP with the Apache or nginx web servers.

For the PHP CLI package:
    
    sudo apt-get install php5-cli

For other PHP extensions:

    sudo apt-get install php5-curl php5-gd php5-json php5-mcrypt php5-mysqlnd


To verify the version of installed php:

    php -v






Eg.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install php7.0   # for PHP 7.0
sudo apt-get install php5.6   # for PHP 5.6
sudo apt-get install php5.5   # for PHP 5.5
