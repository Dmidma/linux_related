Testing is probably the most important phase for long-term support.

1. Unit Testing:

It is tesing one part or more component of the product.  
This makes sure that the component is doing what it is intended to do.

When a developer is confident that a particular part of the software is ready, he can write test cases to test functionality of this part of the software.


2. Sanity Testing:

It is a very basic check to see if all software components compile with each other without a problem.  
This is just to make sure that developers have not defined conflicting or multiple functions or global variable definitions.


3. Regression or Stress Testing:

It is a process done in some projects to carry out a test for a longer period of time.  
It can reveal some bugs in software related to memory leakage.  
The point of this test is to detect any abnormal behaviors.

Another potential problem in long-term operation is counter overflow.  
This occurs when you increment a counter but forget to decrement it, resulting in an overflow.

This testing process requires a very long period of time by its very nature.  
The process should be continued as more components of the product are integrated.


4. Functional Testing:

It is carried out to make sure that the software is doing exactly what it is supposed to do.  
This is done by people whose primary job is software testing.

The software testers need to prepare a testing plan for each component of the software.  
The software tester can prepare these test cases using functional specifications documents.  
Each test case should include methodology used for testing and expected results.  
The tester may also need to create a certain infrastructure or environment to test the functionality of a piece of code.
